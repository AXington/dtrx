Things which I have a use case/anti-use case for:
* Decompress non-archive files.
* DTRT in the "archive contains one file" case.
* Fix permissions as you extract.

Things that are generally good:
* Usage information.
* Better tests.
* Better error messages.

Things I think might be good but can't prove:
* Use zipfile instead of the zip commands.
* Processing from stdin.
* Extracting control.tar.gz from deb files.
