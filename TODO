Things which I have a use case/anti-use case for:
* Fix permissions as you extract.
* Recursive extraction.

Things that are generally good:
* Usage information.
* Better error messages.

Things I think might be good but can't prove:
* Use zipfile instead of the zip commands.
* Processing from stdin.
