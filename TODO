Things which I have a use case/anti-use case for:
* Decompress non-archive files.
* Write tests for extracting in a different directory from where the archives
  live.
* Figure out what to do about warnings in the Handlers.

Things that are generally good:
* Better tests.
* Better error messages.

Things I think might be good but can't prove:
* Consider having options about whether or not to make sane directories,
  have tarbomb protection, etc.
* Use zipfile instead of the zip commands.
* Processing from stdin.
* Extracting control.tar.gz from deb files.
