Things which I have a use case/anti-use case for:
* Take out the shar support, you're probably not gonna use it.
* Handle the one misnamed directory case.
* Provide a real exit status.

Things that are generally good:
* Better error messages:
 * Problems opening/understanding the file.
 * Extra strategies for making a directory, and then better errors.
 * Running subcommands.
* Clean up the run method.
* Usage information.

Things I think might be good but can't prove:
* Use zipfile instead of the zip commands.
* Processing from stdin.
