To do:

* Add a test for the case where you x -l a misnamed file.

* If any of the extraction processes succeeds, only show stderr for that
  one.

* Investigate the right way to handle SIGPIPE and do so.

* When we extract a compressed file (or just one file?), check to see if it
  itself is an archive.  Follow all the usual rules for recursive
  extraction when we do this.

* --expert mode: prompts don't show an explanation of what the options are,
  unless you ask with ?.

Things which I have a use case/anti-use case for:
* Support pisi packages (http://paketler.pardus.org.tr/pardus-2007/)
* Steal ideas from <http://martin.ankerl.com/files/e>.
* More consistently raise and handle exceptions.

Things that are generally good:
* Better tests.
* Better error messages.

Things I think might be good but can't prove:
* Consider having options about whether or not to make sane directories,
  have tarbomb protection, etc.
* Use zipfile instead of the zip commands.
* Processing from stdin.
* shar support.
