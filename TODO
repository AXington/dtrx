To do:
* Fix recursive extraction to check subdirectories
* Add ability to list included archives for recursive extraction
* Make C-c not print a stack trace.
* Make -v report some kind of progress

Things which I have a use case/anti-use case for:
* Support pisi packages (http://paketler.pardus.org.tr/pardus-2007/)
* Steal ideas from <http://martin.ankerl.com/files/e>.
* More consistently raise and handle exceptions.

Things that are generally good:
* Better tests.
* Better error messages.

Things I think might be good but can't prove:
* Consider having options about whether or not to make sane directories,
  have tarbomb protection, etc.
* Use zipfile instead of the zip commands.
* Processing from stdin.
* shar support.
