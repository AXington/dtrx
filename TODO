Things which I have a use case/anti-use case for:
* Clean up ExtractorApplication, ugh.
* Reconsider the current extraction policy for the ONE_DIRECTORY case.
* Decompress non-archive files.

Things that are generally good:
* Better tests.
* Better error messages.

Things I think might be good but can't prove:
* Use zipfile instead of the zip commands.
* Processing from stdin.
* Extracting control.tar.gz from deb files.
