To do:

* Everything is messed up when an archive contains one file.

* The text for when directory names don't match confused Paul.  Consider
  alternatives.  He thinks it would be cool if the actual/expected
  directory names aligned in the output; might need to do your own wrapping
  for this.

* When we list how many archives are in the file, show a count, along with
  the number of regular files in the archive too.  "foo.tar contains 5
  other archives, out of 81 files total."

* When we extract a compressed file, check to see if it itself is an
  archive.  Follow all the usual rules for recursive extraction when we do
  this.

* It seems like when you extract an archive that only has one file, with
  -f, you still get prompted about what to do with it.  -f should always
  assume that everything gets extracted in the current directory.  Track
  this bug down.

Things which I have a use case/anti-use case for:
* Support pisi packages (http://paketler.pardus.org.tr/pardus-2007/)
* Steal ideas from <http://martin.ankerl.com/files/e>.
* More consistently raise and handle exceptions.

Things that are generally good:
* Better tests.
* Better error messages.

Things I think might be good but can't prove:
* Consider having options about whether or not to make sane directories,
  have tarbomb protection, etc.
* Use zipfile instead of the zip commands.
* Processing from stdin.
* shar support.
