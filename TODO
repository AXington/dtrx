* Make sure you only try each extractor once?

Things which I have a use case/anti-use case for:
* Support pisi packages (http://paketler.pardus.org.tr/pardus-2007/)
* Steal ideas from <http://martin.ankerl.com/files/e>.
* Figure out what the deal is with strerror. (done?)
* Better error messages (file doesn't exist, isn't readable, etc.)
* Consistently raise and handle exceptions.

Things that are generally good:
* Better tests.
* Better error messages.

Things I think might be good but can't prove:
* Consider having options about whether or not to make sane directories,
  have tarbomb protection, etc.
* Use zipfile instead of the zip commands.
* Processing from stdin.
* shar support.
