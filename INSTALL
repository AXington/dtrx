============================

Requirements
------------

To run x, you'll need Python_ 2.4 or greater.  You can also use Python 2.3
if you separately install the `subprocess module`_.

.. _Python: http://www.python.org/
.. _`subprocess module`: http://www.lysator.liu.se/~astrand/popen5/

x calls out to different external tools to support different archive types.
Most of these are already installed on most GNU/Linux systems, so you
probably won't have to worry about these too much, but just for
completeness, the exact requirements for each format are as follows:

tar archives
  tar

zip archives
  unzip, zipinfo

cpio archives
  cpio

rpm archives
  rpm2cpio, cpio

deb archives
  ar, tar, zcat

Files compressed with gzip or compress
  zcat

Files compressed with bzip2
  bzcat

Installation
------------

x is just a simple script, making it easy to stash wherever you need it.
Just copy ``scripts/x`` to a location that's convenient for you.  If you'd
like to install the program system-wide, you can run the following as root
or equivalent::

   python setup.py install
